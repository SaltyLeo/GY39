Introduction:

GY-39 is a low cost, air pressure, temperature and humidity, light intensity sensor module. The working voltage is 3-5V. The power consumption is small, and the installation is convenient. The working principle is that the MCU collects various sensor data, performs unified processing, and directly outputs the calculated result. This module has two ways to read data, namely serial UART (TTL level) or IIC (2 line). The baud rate of the serial port is 9600bps and 115200bps, configurable, continuous, and two output modes are requested, and the settings can be saved after power down. It can adapt to different working environments, and connect with single-chip computer and computer. The module can also set a separate sensor chip operating mode. As a separate sensor module, the MCU does not participate in data processing. Provide , 51, stm32 MCU communication program, does not provide schematic and internal MCU source code. This GY39 module also gives Android mobile phone software app to view data, and supports wifi LAN connection, mobile phone and computer display data at the same time.
